# Coding Rules and Development Guidelines v.2.3

This document defines mandatory coding standards for all local projects. The goal is maintainability, scalability, readability, and production-grade structure even in experimental environments.

---

# Core Principles

All code must be:

* readable
* modular
* testable
* documented
* scalable
* predictable
* exception handled
* versioned

Write code as if another senior developer will maintain it tomorrow.
Always create or update the implementationplan.md first before implementing.
Always update documentation *.md as needed.
Add the following author name = "Inventions4All - github:TWeb79"
Add a .gitignore at the end and keep it updated
Add a version number to the UI which represents software version and datetime of deployment

---

# Naming Conventions

## Project Naming

Format:

NN project-name

Example:

23 project-x

Folder format:

23-project-x/

---

## Python Naming

Follow PEP8 strictly.

Examples:

file_name.py
function_name()
ClassName
VARIABLE_NAME

Avoid:

mixedCase
random_short_names
x1_tmp_final2

Names must describe intent.

Example:

calculate_invoice_total()
load_prompt_registry()
create_database_session()

---

## JavaScript Naming

Use:

camelCase for variables/functions
PascalCase for classes
kebab-case for filenames

Example:

fetchUserData()
PromptManager
prompt-service.js

---

## CSS Naming

Use structured class naming.

Recommended:

component-name__element--modifier

Example:

dashboard-card__title
button--primary
navbar__logo

Avoid inline styling.

---

# File Size Limits

Maintain small, readable modules.

Guidelines:

ideal file size: <= 200 lines
maximum file size: 500 lines

If a file exceeds limits:

Split into:

logic
routes
services
utils
models
components

Example:

api/
services/
models/
utils/
routes/

Large files are considered technical debt.

---

# Modular Frontend Structure

Separate responsibilities.

Required structure:

js/
css/
components/

Rules:

no inline JavaScript
no inline CSS
no mixed HTML/logic files

Example:

index.html
js/dashboard.js
css/dashboard.css

---

# Backend Structure (FastAPI Projects)

Recommended layout:

api/
models/
services/
routes/
core/
config/

Example:

routes/
    prompts.py

services/
    prompt_loader.py

Routes must never contain business logic.

Business logic belongs in:

services/

---

# Docker Standards

All containerized services must follow consistent base image and naming conventions to ensure maximum layer sharing, reduced storage usage, and predictable deployments.

## Base Image Standardization

All Docker images must use:

debian:12-slim

This is mandatory unless a technical limitation is explicitly documented. Avoid mixing base distributions (e.g. Alpine, Ubuntu, different Debian versions), as this leads to unnecessary duplication and increased maintenance complexity.

## Naming Conventions

Container, image, and service names must follow project naming rules:

NN-project-name-service-name

Examples:

23-project-x-api
23-project-x-web
23-project-x-worker

Rules:

use lowercase only
use hyphens (-) as separators
no underscores
names must reflect responsibility

## Dockerfile Guidelines

use minimal layers (combine RUN commands)
clean package caches to reduce size
avoid installing unnecessary packages
use multi-stage builds where applicable

Example:

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

## Operational Rules

containers must be reproducible via docker compose
no manual changes inside running containers
all configuration must be version-controlled

## Exceptions

Any deviation from these rules (e.g. Alpine for specific use cases) must be:

documented in ARCHITECTURE.md
justified with technical reasoning

---

# Testing Requirements

Every project must include automated tests.

Allowed frameworks:

pytest (preferred)
unittest (acceptable)

Minimum expectations:

test_services.py
test_routes.py

Example:

tests/
    test_api.py
    test_services.py

Tests must run locally before commits.
Testing must have an 80%+ coverage.

---

# Code Comments (Senior-Level Standard)

Write comments explaining intent — not obvious syntax.

Avoid:

# increment i

Prefer:

# Increment retry counter to prevent infinite loop on failed API responses

Document:

assumptions
side-effects
edge cases
performance decisions
architecture tradeoffs

Functions must include docstrings.

Example:

"""
Loads prompt configuration from YAML registry.

Raises:
    FileNotFoundError
    ValidationError
"""

---

# Documentation Requirements

Each project must contain:

README.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
RULES_coding.md

---

# README.md Requirements

Must include:

project purpose
service ports
startup instructions
dependencies
API endpoints
example requests

README must allow a developer to run the project within minutes.

---

# ARCHITECTURE.md Requirements

Must describe:

system structure
module responsibilities
data flow
external dependencies
service boundaries

Keep diagrams simple when possible.

Example:

Dashboard -> FastAPI -> Service Layer -> Database

Architecture documentation must stay up to date.

---

# Maintainability Rules

Always:

refactor duplicated logic
remove dead code
keep imports clean
avoid hidden dependencies

Never:

commit experimental debug code
leave TODO blocks unresolved long-term
push broken tests

---

# Dependency Management

Each project must include:

requirements.txt

Optional:

pyproject.toml

Pin versions when stability matters.

Example:

fastapi==0.115.*

---

# Logging Standards

Use structured logging.

Example:

logger.info("Prompt registry loaded", extra={"project_id": 23})

Avoid print() in production code.

---

# Testing Standards

Code must be tested, follow the following steps:

1. investigate the project and code
2. describe the functionality of the project to know the sequence of tasks
3. create a test plan based on all features in the code
4. follow the test plan
5. update the test plan and add a oneliner comment per task

---

# Final Rule

Code must be tested, run and understandable without verbal explanation.

If documentation is required to understand basic flow:

Refactor the code.


# Coding Rules for Cookbook Studio Project

## Python Code Style

### Formatting
- Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code
- Use 4 spaces per indentation level (no tabs)
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black formatter default)
- Use blank lines to separate functions and classes
- Import statements should be grouped: standard library, third-party, local

### Naming Conventions
- Use `snake_case` for variables, functions, and methods
- Use `PascalCase` for class names
- Use `UPPER_CASE` for constants
- Use descriptive names; avoid single-letter variables except for iterators
- Prefix private methods with `_`

### Documentation
- All public functions and classes must have docstrings
- Docstrings should follow Google or NumPy style
- Comment complex logic, not obvious code
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

### Code Organization
- Keep functions focused and small (ideally < 50 lines)
- Each function should do one thing well
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Avoid deep nesting (max 3 levels when possible)
- Group related functions together in files

### Error and Exception Handling
- Use specific exceptions rather than bare `except:`
- Handle exceptions at the appropriate level
- Log errors appropriately using the logging module
- Don't suppress exceptions without good reason

### Security
- Never hardcode secrets or passwords
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries for databases
- Be careful with file uploads and paths

### Performance
- Avoid premature optimization
- Use appropriate data structures for the task
- Consider memory usage for large datasets
- Profile code when performance is critical

### Testing
- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Aim for high test coverage (>80%)
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Keep tests fast and independent

## Git Workflow

### Commit Messages
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Format: `type(scope): description`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Keep subject line under 50 characters
- Use imperative mood ("add feature" not "added feature")

### Branching
- Use feature branches for new work
- Keep main branch stable and deployable
- Rebase feature branches before merging
- Delete merged branches

## Specific to This Project

### API Endpoints
- All API endpoints should return JSON
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes
- Handle errors gracefully with meaningful messages
- Validate all input parameters

### File Operations
- Always specify encoding when opening files (use UTF-8)
- Use pathlib for path operations
- Handle file I/O exceptions appropriately
- Close resources properly (use context managers)

### External APIs
- Handle network timeouts and failures
- Implement retry logic where appropriate
- Cache results when beneficial
- Respect rate limits and terms of service
